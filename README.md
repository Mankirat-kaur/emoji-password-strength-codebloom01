# 🔐 Emoji Password Strength Tester

Welcome to the very first project by *2-Bit Coders* — a duo of curious minds (Mankirat & Pooja) diving into development one bit at a time.

This fun little tool helps you check how strong your password is — with *emoji feedback* instead of boring text. Because security can be playful too! 😉

## 🚀 What It Does

- You type a password  
- It checks how strong it is  
- It responds with an emoji that matches the strength  
- Cute, simple, and helpful

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Built using just the basics:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

We’re starting from scratch — learning and building as we go. This is just the beginning. ✨

## 🧠 Why We Made This

We wanted our first project to be:
- Easy to build 🧩  
- Fun to share 😄  
- Useful for beginners too 🧑‍💻  

...and it turned out exactly like that!
